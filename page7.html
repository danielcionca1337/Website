        You know the first one probably would have been more romantic, but I'm here to tell the truth. 
        I have no clue why this is the truth, but I actually had a ton of fun with Dots and Boxes. 
        Then that night I made the realization that I liked you.
        Idk if you even remember when this happened because it was
        in like December I think, but I very clearly remember it.
