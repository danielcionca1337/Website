        Yeah all of those actually were correct answers, some more than others. I'm just using this as a way to be
        completely honest. All this was probably why I was a quiet stutterring mess who apologized like 5 times when
        I asked for your number. The only reason I ended up doing it was because I realized I was kinda a loser because
        I didn't have the courage to make any moves and I realized that wasn't the person I wanted to be.
